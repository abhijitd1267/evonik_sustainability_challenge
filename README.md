## 📈 Overview

This repository documents the technical and sustainability-driven solution submitted for the **Evonik Sustainability Challenge**, focusing on process optimization and energy integration for chemical recycling of PET plastics.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Design an economically viable and sustainable chemical process for recycling PET waste into high-value products, with an emphasis on process simulation, energy efficiency, and environmental impact reduction.

## 🎯 Approach

- **Process Simulation:** Built complete process flow diagrams (PFD) and simulated key unit operations (reactors, distillation, separation) using Aspen Plus.
- **Kinetic Modeling:** Developed kinetic models for PET glycolysis and conducted parametric studies to identify optimal operating conditions.
- **Energy Integration:** Implemented heat recovery, variable frequency drives, and solar PV strategies to reduce total energy consumption by over 15%.
- **Sustainability Assessment:** Quantified emissions, water usage, and cost metrics, comparing conventional vs. integrated designs.
- **Economic Analysis:** Evaluated CAPEX, OPEX, NPV, and payback period, achieving projected payback under 4 years.

## 🏆 Achievements

- Awarded 1st prize out of 10+ finalist teams.
- Demonstrated a feasible high-purity BHET production process (30 kTA), with site selection based on logistics and policy support.
- Generated detailed recommendations for industrial implementation and scale-up.
